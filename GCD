'''

Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.

 

Example 1:

Input: a = 12, b = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The common factors of 12 and 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.

Example 2:

Input: a = 25, b = 30
Output: 2
Explanation: The common factors of 25 and 30 are 1, 5.

 

Constraints:

    1 <= a, b <= 1000

            common_factors += 1
            if i != gcd_value // i:
                common_factors += 1

    return common_factors

# Testing the function
a = 12
b = 6
print(count_common_factors(a, b))  # Output: 4

a = 25
b = 30
print(count_common_factors(a, b))  # Output: 2
